# Polkadot Ecosystem Performance Benchmarks

This repository is meant to aggregate performance benchmarks from the Polkadot Ecosystem.

It is based on [Substrate Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/).

However, instead of `polkadot-launch`, we use [`zombienet`](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) for its convenient features as a DSL-based framework tailored for E2E testing.

Please refer to [docs](./docs) for more information.
