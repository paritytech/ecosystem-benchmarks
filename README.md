# Polkadot sTPS

This repository is meant to aggregate performance benchmarks from the Polkadot Ecosystem and act as source of truth for Standard Transaction Per Second ([sTPS](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-stps/blob/main/docs/introduction.md)).

The measurements are intended to replicate different possible network topologies and provide reference estimates of throughput capacity of substrate-based multichain environments.

[`zombienet`](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) is used as the main tool for spawning networks and sending the transactions towards them.

Please refer to [docs](./docs) for more information.
