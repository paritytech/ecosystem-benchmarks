# Standard Transactions Per Second

Standard Transactions Per Second (sTPS) is a cross chain standard in what counts as a transaction, and basically means a balance-transfer from one pre-existing account to another pre-existing account with neither account having been read from or written to thus far in the block.

Main points of sTPS are:

- Balance transfer
- Neither account may have been read/written/touched/cached thus far in the benchmarks
- No account cleanup
- No account initialisation

Please refer to [methodology.md](./methodology.md) for information on **how** sTPS is being measured in practice, and to [results.md](./results.md) for the actual numbers.
